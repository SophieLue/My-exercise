    <h1>Esprit Nouveau</h1>
   
<h3>Origins and General Concepts:</h3>
<ol>
    <li> <strong>Magazine "L'Esprit Nouveau":</strong> This concept was born in 1920 with the founding of a magazine of the same name, where Le Corbusier and Ozenfant promoted ideas applying industrial principles to artistic and architectural creation. They aimed for a functional and rational aesthetic, which would later form the basis of the modern architectural movement.</li>
    <li><strong>Purism:</strong> <em>Esprit Nouveau</em> is tied to Purism, an artistic movement that championed simplicity, order, and clarity of forms, focusing on basic geometries and pure volumes. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant believed that beauty lay in the efficiency and functionality of objects, not in decoration.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Main Ideas:</h3>
<ol>
    <li> <strong>House as a Machine:</strong> <em>Le Corbusier</em> described the house as a "machine for living in," where function took precedence over form. Architecture, in his view, should follow principles of industrial efficiency.</li>
    <li> <strong>Aesthetic of the Engineer:</strong>  They promoted an aesthetic inspired by modern engineering, emphasizing the use of concrete, steel, and glass.</li>
    <li> <strong>Rejection of Ornament:</strong> <em>Le Corbusier</em> saw ornament as unnecessary and outdated, advocating for architecture with clean, simple lines.</li>
