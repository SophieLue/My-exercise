<h1>"Toward an Architecture" - Le Corbusier  </h1>

<h2> Summary chapters 1 & 2</h2>

<h3>Author</h3>
 <p><strong> Le Corbusier</strong> was a Swiss architect and urban planner, representative of the modern movement. He worked and studied with Auguste Perret, learning about reinforced concrete, as well as working with Mies, Gropius, Wright... He was one of the first to defend standardized building models.</p>


<h3>Context:</h3>
 <p>The book was published in 1921, the context of a world checked by scientific and technological progress, added to the development of productive forces. 
  It was formed from a compilation of articles of the magazine Esprit Nouveau (international magazine of aesthetics) which was designed in 1920 in conjunction with the artist Ozenfant, whose purpose was to be a means to popularize the advances of modernity among the elites, especially the intellectual and artistic ones.

<h3>Chapter 1: Aesthetics of the Engineer </h3>

<p>This first chapter has the intention to imply that it doesn`t make sense to continue copying the forms of ancient classical architecture in a historical context ofindustry in the midst of the 21st century.
  He notes that the civilizations are changing, there is a new way of seeing things, still the way we live remains stagnant The modern world is not being reflected in what is being built. Le Corbusier proposes that we must confront the <strong>architect</strong> with the <em id="semi">engeneer.</em></p>
<p>Architects, still trapped in the academicist approaches of the 19th century, need to learn from the engineers who had been using the achievements of the industrial revolution to create new devices and tools to satisfy needs. The author implies engineers to be the new avant-garde.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2: Three warnings to the architects: <strong> Volume, Surface and Plan </strong></h3>

<p>Architecture expresses itself and “arouses emotions” through 3 components: Volume and surface, which in turn are determined by the 3rd component : the plan. </p>
<p>In the following chapter, Le Corbusier discusses these 3 physical conditions that emanate from architecture, emphasizing, through metaphors, comparisons and explicit examples supported at all times by graphic elements, how each of these can be approached or generated from a wrong or right side. Le Corbusier is extremely taxing in his way of describing each of these components, as he seeks to “warn”, as the title of the chapter says, about what is correct architecture and what is not. </p>
<p><em id="semi"> First warning: <strong>volume. </strong></em> Le Corbusier describes it as an element by which our senses perceive, measure and are fully affected. It is important here the play of volumes gathered under the light as generators of architecture: “Our eyes are made to see the forms under the light”. Here again he praises the work of the engineer with his “spirit through mathematics”, where, by following the geometric orders and their simple and simple figures, he is able to “see the forms under the light”. For Le Corbusier, “The primary forms are the beautiful forms since they are read with clarity”. They are then the primary forms, such as cubes, cones, spheres, cylinders or pyramids. Cases where these forms are represented are the colosseum, the pyramids, Greek architecture, etc. In contemporary architecture, this is reflected in the North American silos. Engineers generated works, where the calculation of them, in order to fulfill their program, ended up generating these simple forms. Just as Le Corbusier describes this architecture of primary forms as correct, he exemplifies those cases where the opposite is true. Gothic architecture, for example, uses complex forms, where the only thing they do is to respond to a difficult problem, in an ingenious way, but incorrect because they do not come from primary forms. </p>
<p><em id="semi"> Second warning: <strong> surface. </strong></em> <em>“The surface of the building is like the skin of man”</em>. It is the building envelope, it should be designed to protect and serve the building, the aesthetics should be unornamented and follow the function. <em> “The building surface should be simple and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary ornamentation that does not contribute to functionality.”</em> It should follow the function of the building, be honest with what happens inside and what it is composed of. Its function, in addition to lending design authenticity to the surface, is to protect the building and be fully functional.</p>
<p><em id="semi"></em>The third and final warning is for the <strong> plan. </strong></em> <em> “The plan is the generator” </em>of the surface and volume. It needs to be clear and efficient to allow for smooth circulation and optimal use of its space. <em>“Without plan, there is only disorder and arbitrariness. Without plan, there is neither grandeur of intention and expression, nor rhythm, nor volume, nor coherence.”</em> </p>
